## Connect the PIR motion sensor

In this project, we are going to be using a **p**assive **i**nfra**r**ed (PIR) motion sensor.

[[[rpi-theory-pir]]]

- Connect your PIR sensor to **GPIO 4**.

[[[rpi-gpio-connect-pir]]]

- On the PIR module you should see two orange components with sockets that fit a Philips screwdriver (see above). These are called potentiometers: they allow you to adjust the sensitivity and the detection time of the sensor. You should begin by setting the sensitivity potentiometer to its maximum and the time potentiometer to its minimum. You can vary this later if you wish.
