## Record multiple videos

--- challenge ---
Every time a new intruder triggers the motion sensor, the video file will be overwritten. If you have lots of pesky parents or siblings intruding into your room, you want to keep videos of all of them. Can you write some code to automatically find out the current date and time, and add it to the name of the video file? Then each video you record will have a different filename.
